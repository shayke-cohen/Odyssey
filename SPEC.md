# ClaudeStudio — Functional Specification

Living specification tracking implemented features, user flows, and requirements.

**Version:** 0.14.1
**Status:** Phase 14 — Project-first shell plus intent-first library hub (`Run`, `Build`, `Discover`)

---

## 1. Product Summary

ClaudeStudio is a native macOS developer tool for managing Claude AI agent sessions around **projects**. Users define reusable agent templates with skills, MCP servers, and permissions, then launch direct or team threads that stream AI responses in real time inside a project-owned workspace.

### Target Users
- Developers using Claude for coding tasks who want persistent, configurable agent sessions
- Teams sharing agent definitions across machines on the same LAN (P2P v1)

### Core Value Proposition
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — run multiple Claude sessions simultaneously with different configurations
- **Composable agents** — build agents from reusable skills, MCP servers, and permission presets
- **Intent-first library hub** — launch agents or groups quickly in `Run`, manage reusable definitions in `Build`, and browse/install templates, skills, and integrations in `Discover`
- **Project-first shell** — each project owns its threads, tasks, schedules, and working context
- **Persistent threads** — thread history survives app restarts, resumable via Claude session IDs
- **Recurring missions** — save agent, group, or thread missions and run them on hourly or daily schedules
- **Native macOS experience** — SwiftUI three-panel layout optimized for developer workflows

### FR-3: Session Lifecycle

**Status:** Implemented

All sessions use the Claude Agent SDK. Every session gets PeerBus tools injected automatically.
Configured skills are carried structurally in `AgentConfig.skills[]` and compiled once into provider instructions inside the sidecar runtimes. `systemPrompt` is reserved for the base agent prompt plus mission, while `mcpServers[]` is the effective executable tool set after merging agent-level MCPs with MCP dependencies declared by enabled skills.

#### Group chat, slash commands, @-mentions, fork (FR-4.9, FR-5.8, FR-5.10, FR-5.11)

- **Per-agent sidecar key:** SwiftData `Session.id.uuidString` is the registry key for `session.create` / `session.message` / streaming maps (the JSON field on `session.create` remains `conversationId` for wire compatibility; the value is the session id).
- **Transcript injection:** When a conversation has more than one `Session`, each outbound message includes a **delta** of shared chat lines since `Session.lastInjectedMessageId`, fenced as `Group thread (new since your last reply)`, plus role instructions and the latest user line. Single-agent chats send the raw user text.
- **User message → all agents:** On send, every `Session` in the conversation receives a `session.message` for that user turn (sorted by `startedAt`). `@Name` mentions **do not** restrict recipients; they add missing agents to the room and add a **highlight line** in the group prompt listing mentioned names.
- **Sequential user turn:** Agents run one after another for the same user message; watermarks advance after each assistant message is persisted so the next agent’s prompt delta includes prior replies.
- **Peer fan-out (`may_reply`):** After each assistant `ConversationMessage` is saved, the app sends an additional `session.message` to every **other** session using `GroupPromptBuilder.buildPeerNotifyPrompt` (header `Group chat: peer message`). Recipients may reply; replies are persisted and can trigger further fan-out. **`GroupPeerFanOutContext`** caps extra sidecar turns per user send (default 12) and dedupes `(targetSessionId, triggerMessageId)` so the same notify is not sent twice. Sessions that have **not yet** run their user-turn message in the current batch are **skipped** for fan-out (their upcoming prompt already includes the new lines).
- **Watermarks:** Documented on `GroupPromptBuilder` — only `advanceWatermark` moves `lastInjectedMessageId` for a session’s own assistant message; skipped fan-out recipients rely on the next `buildMessageText` delta.
- **@-mentions:** Tokens `@Name` match installed agents by name (case-insensitive). Unknown names show an error and do not call the sidecar. Mentioning an agent not yet in the room provisions a `Session`, adds a participant, and includes them in the current send. Composer chips show **In chat** vs **Adds on send**.
- **Slash commands (first line):** `/help`, `/topic` or `/rename <title>`, `/agents`. A line starting with `//` is not a command.
- **Fork:** **Fork conversation** (header menu) clones the thread and primary session mapping, then sends `session.fork` with parent and child primary session ids. **Fork from here** (message context menu) clones through the selected message inclusive; SDK continuity follows sidecar `forkSession` behavior.
- **Composer:** **Return** inserts a newline; **⌘↩** or the Send button sends.

**Tests:** `ClaudeStudioTests/GroupPromptBuilderTests.swift` (transcript, peer prompt, mentions, fan-out context). Sidecar live E2E `GC-1` / `GC-2` in `sidecar/test/e2e/scenarios.test.ts` (group-style and peer-notify prompts).

### Phase 9 — UX principles

- **Workspace truth** — Clone path and repo/branch shown in New Session and Agent Editor before tools run; failures show inline with retry (Validate / update clone).
- **Progress** — Indeterminate `ProgressView` while clone runs from New Session or editor.
- **Peer UI** — Peer Network uses the same sheet pattern as Agent Comms; empty state explains same-network requirement.
- **Accessibility** — `newSession.githubWorkspaceModePicker`, `newSession.githubValidateButton`, `peerNetwork.*`, `agentEditor.githubClonePathLabel`, `agentEditor.githubValidateButton` (see `TESTING.md` / `CLAUDE.md` for full prefix rules).

### Phase 9 — Wireframes (reference)

- **WF1 (New Session)** — Segmented control for directory mode; repo + local clone path + branch caption; optional error line; Validate/update clone when GitHub mode is selected.
- **WF2 (Agent Editor)** — Workspace section extended with read-only clone path and Validate/update clone.
- **WF3 (Peer Network)** — `HSplitView`: peer list (left), detail with “Browse agents” and remote agent rows with Import (right).
- **WF4 (Import)** — Inline confirmation text after Import; missing skills/MCPs omitted with resolved names where they exist locally.

- [x] Code blocks display with language label and monospaced font
- [x] Code blocks have a Copy button that copies contents to clipboard
- [x] Links are clickable and open in the default browser
- [x] User messages remain plain text (not rendered as markdown)
- [x] Streaming text appears live as it arrives (not just animated dots)
- [x] Can copy any message via hover copy button

### US-21: Manage Tasks on a Board
**As a** developer, **I want to** create and manage tasks that agents can claim and work on, **so that** I can orchestrate work through a shared task queue.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] Can create tasks with title, description, priority, and labels
- [x] Tasks flow through lifecycle (backlog → ready → inProgress → done/failed)
- [x] Agents can list, claim, and update tasks via PeerBus tools
- [x] Sidebar shows active and completed tasks
- [x] Can "Run with Orchestrator" to auto-assign tasks
- [x] Subtask decomposition supported

### US-22: Use Plan Mode for Interactive Planning
**As a** developer, **I want to** toggle plan mode for a conversation so the agent gathers requirements, explores the codebase, and presents a visual plan before implementing anything.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] Plan mode toggle persisted per conversation
- [x] Agent uses Opus model for better reasoning
- [x] Agent gathers requirements via interactive ask_user forms
- [x] Agent presents plans with Mermaid diagrams and HTML
- [x] Agent does NOT write files in plan mode
- [x] Plan can be approved, refined, or rejected

### US-23: View Unified Debug Logs
**As a** developer, **I want to** see both Swift app logs and sidecar logs in one unified debug view, **so I can** troubleshoot issues without switching between tools.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] Debug Log View shows combined Swift + sidecar logs
- [x] Can filter by level, source, category, and free text
- [x] Logs stream in real-time with auto-scroll
- [x] Can copy filtered logs to clipboard

---

## 6. Change Log

| Date | Change | Affected |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-03-21 | Lightweight ChatHandler for simple sessions: routes sessions without tools/MCPs/skills to `claude --print` instead of full Agent SDK. Response polling in Swift saves agent replies to SwiftData. Fixed AgentLibrary sheet presentation, added indigo/gray agent colors, built-in agent loading. | FR-2.10, FR-2.14, FR-3.15-3.17, Flow 6 |
| 2026-03-21 | Rich markdown chat: MarkdownUI rendering for agent messages, code blocks with copy button, live streaming text, hover copy/timestamp, clickable links. Settings screen: three-tab preferences (General/Connection/Advanced) with dark mode, port/path overrides, reset. SidecarManager accepts configurable settings. | FR-5.18-5.25, FR-9, US-8, US-9, Flow 4, Flow 5 |
| 2026-03-21 | UX improvements: smart naming, conversation management (rename/pin/close/delete/duplicate), New Session sheet, sidebar polish (timestamps, previews, pinned section, empty state, agent icons, swipe actions), chat header enhancements (rename, close/resume, clear, model pill, cost), inspector actions (pause/resume/stop, editable topic, open in editor), agent card Start button | FR-5, FR-6, US-6, US-7, Flow 1, Flow 3 |
| 2026-03-21 | File attachments: added txt/md/pdf support alongside images. Text/markdown files inlined in prompt, images/PDFs via temp files. Generalized wire protocol from WireImageAttachment to WireAttachment. Document thumbnails with icon+name+size. Sidebar shows context-aware attachment icons. | FR-5.9, FR-10, US-9, Flow 7 |
| 2026-03-21 | Multi-instance support: InstanceConfig parses `--instance <name>`, namespaces SwiftData/blackboard/logs/UserDefaults per instance, dynamic port allocation for non-default instances, CLAUDESTUDIO_DATA_DIR env var for sidecar, window title with instance name. | FR-10, US-10, Flow 7, NFR |
| 2026-03-21 | Catalog system: directory-based catalog with 30 agents, 101 skills, 100 MCPs. CatalogService with loading, find, install/uninstall, cascading dependency resolution. CatalogBrowserView with tabs, search, category filter. CatalogDetailView with full item information, collapsible system prompt, FlowLayout triggers, install/uninstall actions. Per-agent .md system prompts. Agent → Skill → MCP hierarchy. | FR-2.15-2.18, FR-12, US-11, Flow 9, Flow 10 |
| 2026-03-29 | Intent-first library hub: replaced object-first library navigation with `Run`, `Build`, and `Discover`; groups promoted as first-class reusable teams; catalog browsing repositioned under Discover; added adaptive compact layout for narrower library sheets; added agent creation entry flow (`Create Blank` / `From Prompt`). | FR-6.22, FR-12A, FR-12.18-12.30 |
| 2026-03-21 | Test infrastructure: ClaudeStudioTests XCTest target with 61 tests covering catalog model decoding, service operations (install/uninstall/cascading/idempotent/dependency resolution), data integrity (unique IDs, valid cross-references), InstanceConfig (directories, UserDefaults, ports). Fixed catalog skill ID case mismatches across 20 agent files. Added InstanceConfig.swift to project, fixed Swift 6 concurrency warning in AppSettings. | FR-13, NFR |
| 2026-03-21 | Initial spec created from implemented codebase | All sections |
| 2026-03-21 | Phase 4: Inter-Agent Communication. Full PeerBus tool suite (17 tools) implemented as in-process MCP server injected into every Agent SDK session. Tools: blackboard_read/write/query/subscribe, peer_send_message/broadcast/receive_messages/list_agents/delegate_task, peer_chat_start/reply/listen/close/invite, workspace_create/join/list. New stores: MessageStore, ChatChannelStore (with deadlock detection), WorkspaceStore. Refactored sidecar: shared ToolContext, SessionManager accepts injected registry and context, WsServer accepts injected dependencies, agent.register command. Swift: AppState handles all peer/blackboard events, persists to SwiftData, registers agent definitions on connect. New AgentCommsView with filter tabs. Sidebar enhanced with parent-child conversation nesting and type-specific icons. Removed stale ChatHandler references from FR-3 and Flow 6. | FR-3.15-3.18, FR-4.8, FR-7.9-7.11, FR-14, FR-15, US-12, US-13, Flow 6 |
| 2026-03-22 | Phase 4.5: Built-in Ecosystem. Full first-launch seeding: DefaultsSeeder expanded from permissions-only to 5 categories (permissions, MCPs, skills, agents, templates). Created 3 system prompt templates (specialist.md, worker.md, coordinator.md) with variable resolution. Agent seeding resolves cross-entity references by name (skills, MCPs, permissions). All 30 catalog agents updated with PeerBus system skills (peer-collaboration, blackboard-patterns, agent-identity) in requiredSkills — every agent in ClaudeStudio knows how to collaborate via PeerBus. 131 Swift tests + 96 sidecar tests passing. | FR-16, US-15 |
| 2026-03-22 | Phase 6: UX Redesign + Inspector Toggle. Comprehensive UX overhaul: Settings reorganized into General/Connection (with live sidecar status and action buttons)/Developer tabs. Sidebar toolbar replaced with bottom bar (Catalog, Agents, + buttons). Main toolbar simplified to New Session + Quick Chat + status pill + inspector toggle. Chat header: tappable agent icon opens library, mission preview, Fork/Rename moved to overflow menu. Inspector transformed into monitoring dashboard with usage section (tokens, cost, turns progress bar), workspace section with Open in Terminal, and removed duplicate controls. New Session sheet: recent agents row, collapsible options DisclosureGroup, "Inherit from Agent" model default, mode tooltips. Agent Editor consolidated from 5 steps to 3 (Identity, Capabilities with Skills/MCPs/Permissions DisclosureGroups, System Prompt). Inspector toggle: toolbar button (sidebar.trailing, ⌘⌥0) shows/hides right inspector pane; chat expands to fill freed space via 2-column NavigationSplitView + HStack layout. Fixed macOS state restoration crash (WorkingDirectoryPicker environment object). Fixed FileNode Swift 6 concurrency (nonisolated init, @unchecked Sendable). | FR-6.14-6.21, FR-9.1, US-7, US-8, Flow 4 |
| 2026-03-22 | Phase 5: Inspector File Explorer. Tabbed Inspector (Info/Files) with file tree browser for agent working directories. FileSystemService, GitService, FileNode model. FileTreeView with DisclosureGroup, git badges, changes-only filter. FileContentView with three modes: Markdown preview, syntax-highlighted source (Highlightr), git diff (NSTextView). Async I/O, auto-refresh on tool calls, HighlightedCodeView for chat code blocks, dynamic git path, full a11y identifiers. | FR-17, FR-18, US-16, Flow 11 |
| 2026-03-22 | Phase 7: Agent Communication Wiring + Delegation UI. Wired AgentCommsView into MainWindowView (toolbar button with antenna icon + event badge, ⌘⇧A shortcut, sheet presentation). Added user-initiated delegation from chat: delegate menu button in input bar, agent picker menu, DelegateSheet (task editor, context field, wait-for-result toggle). New delegate.task sidecar command with full wire protocol (SidecarProtocol → ws-server.ts). Instance policy enforcement in both peer_delegate_task and delegate.task handler: singleton reuses existing session, pool caps at max then routes to least-busy, spawn always creates new. Added findByAgentName to SessionRegistry. Fixed pool serialization to pool:N format in AppState. Added peer_chat_listen to AgentProvisioner allowedTools. | FR-3.14, FR-3.19, FR-5.26-5.29, FR-14.23-14.24, FR-15.8-15.9, US-12, US-13, US-17, Flow 12, Flow 13 |
| 2026-03-22 | Phase 8: Group conversations (`Conversation.sessions`), per-session transcript watermarks, `GroupPromptBuilder` injection, sequential multi-agent sends, New Session multi-select, `/help` `/topic` `/rename` `/agents`, @-mention routing and add-on-send with autocomplete hints, fork from message + `session.fork`/`session.forked` with explicit child session id, inspector multi-session list, ⌘↩ to send / Return for newline in composer. | FR-4.9, FR-5.8, FR-5.10, FR-5.11, FR-3.11 |
| 2026-03-22 | Group chat peer fan-out: each user turn messages **all** sessions; after each assistant reply, automatic `session.message` to other agents (`Group chat: peer message`) with `GroupPeerFanOutContext` turn budget + dedup; skip fan-out to sessions still pending their user-turn message. Extended `GroupPromptBuilderTests`; sidecar E2E GC-2; docs in README, TESTING.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md. | FR-4.9, FR-5.10, NFR (tests) |
| 2026-03-22 | Phase 9: GitHub workspace (`WorkspaceResolver`, `GitHubIntegration`, `GitWorkspacePreparer`), New Session GitHub mode + Agent Editor validate/update clone, `ChatView` pre-provision clone; P2P v1 (`P2PNetworkManager`, `PeerCatalogServer`, `PeerNetworkView`, `PeerAgentImporter`, wire DTOs), toolbar ⌘⇧P; `WorkspaceResolverTests`; `xcodegen` for new Swift files. Flows 14–16, FR-19–20, US-18–19. | FR-19, FR-20, US-18, US-19, Flow 14–16, NFR |
| 2026-03-25 | Launch parameters & URL scheme: `LaunchIntent` type with CLI (`--chat`, `--agent`, `--group`, `--prompt`, `--workdir`, `--autonomous`) and `claudestudio://` URL parsers. `AppState.executeLaunchIntent()` creates session from SwiftData lookup. Auto-send prompt queued and drained on sidecar connect. `Info.plist` registers URL scheme. Error alert for missing agent/group. Combinable with `--instance`. | FR-21, US-20, Flow 17 |
| 2026-03-25 | Phase 10: Rich display tools (ask_user, render_content, show_progress, suggest_actions) as MCP injected into all sessions. Auto-expanding chat input with Shift+Enter newlines. | FR-25, FR-5 |
| 2026-03-26 | Phase 11: Task Board system. TaskItem SwiftData model, TaskBoardStore in sidecar with persistence, 4 PeerBus tools (task_board_list/create/claim/update), REST API endpoints, TaskCreationSheet and TaskEditSheet in UI, sidebar tasks section, task-board-patterns skill, wire protocol events. group_invite_agent chat tool. | FR-22, FR-26, US-21 |
| 2026-03-26 | Phase 12: Plan mode and logging. Custom plan mode via system prompt injection (not SDK plan mode). Opus override, interactive planning workflow (ask_user → show_progress → render_content → suggest_actions). Structured JSON logging in sidecar (logger.ts), Swift Log enum with OSLog, UnifiedLogEntry, LogAggregator, DebugLogView. Sidebar bottom bar refactored with SidebarBottomBarItem enum and adaptive layout. | FR-23, FR-24, US-22, US-23 |
| 2026-03-27 | Phase 13: Scheduled Missions. Added SwiftData models for schedules and run history, schedule engine + run coordinator, prompt templating, launchd sync, schedule launch intents, Schedule Library/detail/editor UI, chat/group scheduling entry points, schedule accessibility IDs, AppXray schedule smoke tests, and execution-path XCTest coverage. Also fixed catalog fallback loading for bundled `github-workflow` skill so catalog integrity and cascading install tests stay green. | FR-27, FR-12, FR-13 |

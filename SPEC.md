# ClaudPeer — Functional Specification

Living specification tracking implemented features, user flows, and requirements.

**Version:** 0.8.1
**Status:** Phase 8 — Group chat (incl. peer fan-out), slash commands, @-mentions, fork-from-message

---

## 1. Product Summary

ClaudPeer is a native macOS developer tool for managing multiple Claude AI agent sessions. Users define reusable agent templates with skills, MCP servers, and permissions, then launch interactive sessions that stream AI responses in real-time through a chat interface.

### Target Users
- Developers using Claude for coding tasks who want persistent, configurable agent sessions
- Teams wanting to share agent definitions across machines (planned)

### Core Value Proposition
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — run multiple Claude sessions simultaneously with different configurations
- **Composable agents** — build agents from reusable skills, MCP servers, and permission presets
- **Curated catalog** — browse and install from 30 agents, 101 skills, and 100 MCP servers with cascading dependency resolution
- **Persistent conversations** — conversations survive app restarts, resumable via Claude session IDs
- **Native macOS experience** — SwiftUI three-panel layout optimized for developer workflows

#### Group chat, slash commands, @-mentions, fork (FR-4.9, FR-5.8, FR-5.10, FR-5.11)

- **Per-agent sidecar key:** SwiftData `Session.id.uuidString` is the registry key for `session.create` / `session.message` / streaming maps (the JSON field on `session.create` remains `conversationId` for wire compatibility; the value is the session id).
- **Transcript injection:** When a conversation has more than one `Session`, each outbound message includes a **delta** of shared chat lines since `Session.lastInjectedMessageId`, fenced as `Group thread (new since your last reply)`, plus role instructions and the latest user line. Single-agent chats send the raw user text.
- **User message → all agents:** On send, every `Session` in the conversation receives a `session.message` for that user turn (sorted by `startedAt`). `@Name` mentions **do not** restrict recipients; they add missing agents to the room and add a **highlight line** in the group prompt listing mentioned names.
- **Sequential user turn:** Agents run one after another for the same user message; watermarks advance after each assistant message is persisted so the next agent’s prompt delta includes prior replies.
- **Peer fan-out (`may_reply`):** After each assistant `ConversationMessage` is saved, the app sends an additional `session.message` to every **other** session using `GroupPromptBuilder.buildPeerNotifyPrompt` (header `Group chat: peer message`). Recipients may reply; replies are persisted and can trigger further fan-out. **`GroupPeerFanOutContext`** caps extra sidecar turns per user send (default 12) and dedupes `(targetSessionId, triggerMessageId)` so the same notify is not sent twice. Sessions that have **not yet** run their user-turn message in the current batch are **skipped** for fan-out (their upcoming prompt already includes the new lines).
- **Watermarks:** Documented on `GroupPromptBuilder` — only `advanceWatermark` moves `lastInjectedMessageId` for a session’s own assistant message; skipped fan-out recipients rely on the next `buildMessageText` delta.
- **@-mentions:** Tokens `@Name` match installed agents by name (case-insensitive). Unknown names show an error and do not call the sidecar. Mentioning an agent not yet in the room provisions a `Session`, adds a participant, and includes them in the current send. Composer chips show **In chat** vs **Adds on send**.
- **Slash commands (first line):** `/help`, `/topic` or `/rename <title>`, `/agents`. A line starting with `//` is not a command.
- **Fork:** **Fork conversation** (header menu) clones the thread and primary session mapping, then sends `session.fork` with parent and child primary session ids. **Fork from here** (message context menu) clones through the selected message inclusive; SDK continuity follows sidecar `forkSession` behavior.
- **Composer:** **Return** inserts a newline; **⌘↩** or the Send button sends.

**Tests:** `ClaudPeerTests/GroupPromptBuilderTests.swift` (transcript, peer prompt, mentions, fan-out context). Sidecar live E2E `GC-1` / `GC-2` in `sidecar/test/e2e/scenarios.test.ts` (group-style and peer-notify prompts).

## 6. Change Log

| Date | Change | Affected |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-03-21 | Lightweight ChatHandler for simple sessions: routes sessions without tools/MCPs/skills to `claude --print` instead of full Agent SDK. Response polling in Swift saves agent replies to SwiftData. Fixed AgentLibrary sheet presentation, added indigo/gray agent colors, built-in agent loading. | FR-2.10, FR-2.14, FR-3.15-3.17, Flow 6 |
| 2026-03-21 | Rich markdown chat: MarkdownUI rendering for agent messages, code blocks with copy button, live streaming text, hover copy/timestamp, clickable links. Settings screen: three-tab preferences (General/Connection/Advanced) with dark mode, port/path overrides, reset. SidecarManager accepts configurable settings. | FR-5.18-5.25, FR-9, US-8, US-9, Flow 4, Flow 5 |
| 2026-03-21 | UX improvements: smart naming, conversation management (rename/pin/close/delete/duplicate), New Session sheet, sidebar polish (timestamps, previews, pinned section, empty state, agent icons, swipe actions), chat header enhancements (rename, close/resume, clear, model pill, cost), inspector actions (pause/resume/stop, editable topic, open in editor), agent card Start button | FR-5, FR-6, US-6, US-7, Flow 1, Flow 3 |
| 2026-03-21 | File attachments: added txt/md/pdf support alongside images. Text/markdown files inlined in prompt, images/PDFs via temp files. Generalized wire protocol from WireImageAttachment to WireAttachment. Document thumbnails with icon+name+size. Sidebar shows context-aware attachment icons. | FR-5.9, FR-10, US-9, Flow 7 |
| 2026-03-21 | Multi-instance support: InstanceConfig parses `--instance <name>`, namespaces SwiftData/blackboard/logs/UserDefaults per instance, dynamic port allocation for non-default instances, CLAUDPEER_DATA_DIR env var for sidecar, window title with instance name. | FR-10, US-10, Flow 7, NFR |
| 2026-03-21 | Catalog system: directory-based catalog with 30 agents, 101 skills, 100 MCPs. CatalogService with loading, find, install/uninstall, cascading dependency resolution. CatalogBrowserView with tabs, search, category filter. CatalogDetailView with full item information, collapsible system prompt, FlowLayout triggers, install/uninstall actions. Per-agent .md system prompts. Agent → Skill → MCP hierarchy. | FR-2.15-2.18, FR-12, US-11, Flow 9, Flow 10 |
| 2026-03-21 | Test infrastructure: ClaudPeerTests XCTest target with 61 tests covering catalog model decoding, service operations (install/uninstall/cascading/idempotent/dependency resolution), data integrity (unique IDs, valid cross-references), InstanceConfig (directories, UserDefaults, ports). Fixed catalog skill ID case mismatches across 20 agent files. Added InstanceConfig.swift to project, fixed Swift 6 concurrency warning in AppSettings. | FR-13, NFR |
| 2026-03-21 | Initial spec created from implemented codebase | All sections |
| 2026-03-21 | Phase 4: Inter-Agent Communication. Full PeerBus tool suite (17 tools) implemented as in-process MCP server injected into every Agent SDK session. Tools: blackboard_read/write/query/subscribe, peer_send_message/broadcast/receive_messages/list_agents/delegate_task, peer_chat_start/reply/listen/close/invite, workspace_create/join/list. New stores: MessageStore, ChatChannelStore (with deadlock detection), WorkspaceStore. Refactored sidecar: shared ToolContext, SessionManager accepts injected registry and context, WsServer accepts injected dependencies, agent.register command. Swift: AppState handles all peer/blackboard events, persists to SwiftData, registers agent definitions on connect. New AgentCommsView with filter tabs. Sidebar enhanced with parent-child conversation nesting and type-specific icons. Removed stale ChatHandler references from FR-3 and Flow 6. | FR-3.15-3.18, FR-4.8, FR-7.9-7.11, FR-14, FR-15, US-12, US-13, Flow 6 |
| 2026-03-22 | Phase 4.5: Built-in Ecosystem. Full first-launch seeding: DefaultsSeeder expanded from permissions-only to 5 categories (permissions, MCPs, skills, agents, templates). Created 3 system prompt templates (specialist.md, worker.md, coordinator.md) with variable resolution. Agent seeding resolves cross-entity references by name (skills, MCPs, permissions). All 30 catalog agents updated with PeerBus system skills (peer-collaboration, blackboard-patterns, agent-identity) in requiredSkills — every agent in ClaudPeer knows how to collaborate via PeerBus. 131 Swift tests + 96 sidecar tests passing. | FR-16, US-15 |
| 2026-03-22 | Phase 6: UX Redesign + Inspector Toggle. Comprehensive UX overhaul: Settings reorganized into General/Connection (with live sidecar status and action buttons)/Developer tabs. Sidebar toolbar replaced with bottom bar (Catalog, Agents, + buttons). Main toolbar simplified to New Session + Quick Chat + status pill + inspector toggle. Chat header: tappable agent icon opens library, mission preview, Fork/Rename moved to overflow menu. Inspector transformed into monitoring dashboard with usage section (tokens, cost, turns progress bar), workspace section with Open in Terminal, and removed duplicate controls. New Session sheet: recent agents row, collapsible options DisclosureGroup, "Inherit from Agent" model default, mode tooltips. Agent Editor consolidated from 5 steps to 3 (Identity, Capabilities with Skills/MCPs/Permissions DisclosureGroups, System Prompt). Inspector toggle: toolbar button (sidebar.trailing, ⌘⌥0) shows/hides right inspector pane; chat expands to fill freed space via 2-column NavigationSplitView + HStack layout. Fixed macOS state restoration crash (WorkingDirectoryPicker environment object). Fixed FileNode Swift 6 concurrency (nonisolated init, @unchecked Sendable). | FR-6.14-6.21, FR-9.1, US-7, US-8, Flow 4 |
| 2026-03-22 | Phase 5: Inspector File Explorer. Tabbed Inspector (Info/Files) with file tree browser for agent working directories. FileSystemService, GitService, FileNode model. FileTreeView with DisclosureGroup, git badges, changes-only filter. FileContentView with three modes: Markdown preview, syntax-highlighted source (Highlightr), git diff (NSTextView). Async I/O, auto-refresh on tool calls, HighlightedCodeView for chat code blocks, dynamic git path, full a11y identifiers. | FR-17, FR-18, US-16, Flow 11 |
| 2026-03-22 | Phase 7: Agent Communication Wiring + Delegation UI. Wired AgentCommsView into MainWindowView (toolbar button with antenna icon + event badge, ⌘⇧A shortcut, sheet presentation). Added user-initiated delegation from chat: delegate menu button in input bar, agent picker menu, DelegateSheet (task editor, context field, wait-for-result toggle). New delegate.task sidecar command with full wire protocol (SidecarProtocol → ws-server.ts). Instance policy enforcement in both peer_delegate_task and delegate.task handler: singleton reuses existing session, pool caps at max then routes to least-busy, spawn always creates new. Added findByAgentName to SessionRegistry. Fixed pool serialization to pool:N format in AppState. Added peer_chat_listen to AgentProvisioner allowedTools. | FR-3.14, FR-3.19, FR-5.26-5.29, FR-14.23-14.24, FR-15.8-15.9, US-12, US-13, US-17, Flow 12, Flow 13 |
| 2026-03-22 | Phase 8: Group conversations (`Conversation.sessions`), per-session transcript watermarks, `GroupPromptBuilder` injection, sequential multi-agent sends, New Session multi-select, `/help` `/topic` `/rename` `/agents`, @-mention routing and add-on-send with autocomplete hints, fork from message + `session.fork`/`session.forked` with explicit child session id, inspector multi-session list, ⌘↩ to send / Return for newline in composer. | FR-4.9, FR-5.8, FR-5.10, FR-5.11, FR-3.11 |
| 2026-03-22 | Group chat peer fan-out: each user turn messages **all** sessions; after each assistant reply, automatic `session.message` to other agents (`Group chat: peer message`) with `GroupPeerFanOutContext` turn budget + dedup; skip fan-out to sessions still pending their user-turn message. Extended `GroupPromptBuilderTests`; sidecar E2E GC-2; docs in README, TESTING.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md. | FR-4.9, FR-5.10, NFR (tests) |
